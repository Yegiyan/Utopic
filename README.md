# Utopic

If you've ever muttered, "I'd certainly do better if I ruled that country", then this game is for you! Utopic is a faithful recreation of the classic 1981 Intellivision game, Utopia. Players are tasked with managing their territories and balancing resource gathering, population growth, and economic development in order to create the perfect Utopia.

Some cool additions in this remake include:

* Modifying the number of fish, pirates, weather, and gold
* Smaller tiles that give room for placing many more buildings
* An AI opponent to play against! AI vs AI also available
* End game score screen

Made with Visual Studio 2022 using Raylib's C# bindings
